/*
Write a class named Employee that has the following fields:

name. the name field references a String object that holds the employee’s name.
idNumber. The idNumber is an int variable that holds the employee’s ID number.
department. The department field references a String object that holds the name of the department where the employee works.
positon. The position field references a String object that holds the employee’s job title.
The class should have the following constructors:

A constructor that accepts the following values as arguments and assigns them to the appropriate fields: employee’s name, employee’s ID number, department, and position.
A constructor that accepts the following values as arguments and assigns them to the appropriate fields: employee’s name and ID number. 
The department and position fields should be assigned an empty string (“”).
A no-arg constructor that assigns empty strings (“”) to the name, department, and position fields, and 0 to the idNumber field.
Write the appropriate mutator methods (also called setters) that store values in these fields and accessor methods (getters) that return the values in these fields. 
Once you have written the class, write a separate program that creates three Employee objects to hold the following data:

 

Name                           ID Number                              Department                             Position

Susan Myers                47899                                      Accounting                                Vice President

Mark Jones                  39119                                      IT                                             Programmer

Joy Rogers                   81774                                     Manufacturing                            Engineer

 

The program should use each of the three constructors (a different one for each case) to build and store this data in three Employee objects, and then display the data for each employee on the screen.

 

Output should look like the following:

Employee #1

Name: Susan Meyers

ID Number: 47899

Department: Accounting

Position: Vice President

 

Employee #2

Name: Mark Jones

ID Number: 39119

Department: IT

Position: Programmer

 

Employee #3

Name: Joy Rogers

ID Number: 81774

Department: Manufacturing

Position: Engineer
