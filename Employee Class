A constructor that accepts the following values as arguments and assigns them to the appropriate fields: employee’s name and ID number. The department and position fields should be assigned an empty string (“”).
A no-arg constructor that assigns empty strings (“”) to the name, department, and position fields, and 0 to the idNumber field.
Write the appropriate mutator methods (also called setters) that store values in these fields and accessor methods (getters) that return the values in these fields. Once you have written the class, write a separate program that creates three Employee objects to hold the following data:
