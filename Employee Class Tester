/*
Once you have written the class, write a separate program that creates three Employee objects to hold the following data:

 

Name                           ID Number                              Department                             Position

Susan Myers                47899                                      Accounting                                Vice President

Mark Jones                  39119                                      IT                                             Programmer

Joy Rogers                   81774                                     Manufacturing                            Engineer

 

The program should use each of the three constructors (a different one for each case) to build and store this data in three Employee objects, and then display the data for each employee on the screen.

 

Output should look like the following:

Employee #1

Name: Susan Meyers

ID Number: 47899

Department: Accounting

Position: Vice President

 

Employee #2

Name: Mark Jones

ID Number: 39119

Department: IT

Position: Programmer

 

Employee #3

Name: Joy Rogers

ID Number: 81774

Department: Manufacturing

Position: Engineer
