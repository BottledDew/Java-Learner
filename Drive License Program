/*
ASSIGNMENT
The local Driver's License Office has asked you to write a program that grades the written portion of a driver's license exam. 
The exam has 20 multiple choice questions. Here are the correct answers:

1. B                  6. A                 11. B                  16. C

2. D                  7. B                 12. C                  17. C

3. A                  8. A                 13. D                  18. B

4. A                  9. C                 14. A                  19. D

5. C                 10. D                 15. D                  20. A

A student must correctly answer 15 of the 20 questions to pass the exam.

Write a class named DriverExam that holds the correct answers to the exam in an array field. 
The class should also have an array field that that holds the student answers. The class should have the following methods:

passed. Returns true if the student passed the exam, or false if the student failed.
totalCorrect: Returns the total number of correctly answered questions.
totalIncorrect: Returns the total number of incorrectly answered questions.
questionsMissed: Returns an int array containing the question numbers of the questions that the student missed.
Demonstrate the class in a complete program that asks the user to enter a student's answers, 
and then displays the results returned from the DriverExam class's methods.

Input Validation: Only accept the letters A, B, C, or D as answers.
