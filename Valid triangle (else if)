/* Write a program named Triangle.java that asks for the lengths of the three sides of a triangle
and computes the perimeter if the input is valid.
The input is valid if the sum of every pair of two sides is greater than the remaining side.
For example, the lengths 3, 4, and 5 define a valid triangle:
3 plus 4 is greater than 5; 4  plus 5 is greater than 3, and 5 plus 3 is greater than 4.
However, the lengths 7, 2, and 4 do not specify a valid triangle because 2 plus 4 is not greater than 7.

Enter lengths of sides of the triangle: 3 4 5
The perimeter of the triangle is 12.0
